# Yelp-Web-API Service Wrapper

This is a .Net (VS 20013 .net 4.5) service wrapper used to leverage Yelp's Business and
Search Web APIs.

## Code Example

```cs

 			var businessRequest = new BusinessRequest 
            {   
                ConsumerKey = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ConsumerKey"],
                ConsumerSecret = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ConsumerSecret"],
                Token = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["Token"],
                TokenSecret = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["TokenSecret"],
                BusinessId = "yelp-san-francisco"
            };

            using (var businessAdapter = new BusinessAdapter(businessRequest))
            {

                var response = businessAdapter.GetYelpBusinessResults();
                
                Console.WriteLine(response.Success);

                if(!response.Success)
                    Console.WriteLine(response.ErrorMessage);

                Console.WriteLine(response.YelpData);

                Console.ReadLine();

            }
            
```

## Motivation

The objective is to create a series of Service Wrappers to help developers leverage 
popular Web APIs--in this case Yelp.

## Installation
The downloadable zip is a solution that comes with the ServiceWrapper Project as well as a 
test Client project. To install you'll need VS2013 or greater, and be able to support
.Net 4.5.

To use the Service Wrapper project it's recommend you generate a dll (build the project)
and drop it into whatever solution you're working on. Also xml markup comments were 
included so if you go into the project properties and select generate xml markup file you 
can include that file along with the dll, which will grant you intellisense. 

Lastly since this project leverages the Yelp API you'll need to create a developer account
if you don't already have one. It's a quick 2 minute process. Once you've done that you'll
be able to generate a ConsumerKey, ConsumerSecret, Token, and TokenSecret access key.
You'll need to add these to your appsettings so that Yelp's API can authenticate you.

```
  <appSettings>
    <add key="ConsumerKey" value="" />
    <add key="ConsumerSecret" value="" />
    <add key="Token" value="" />
    <add key="TokenSecret" value="" />
  </appSettings>
 ```
